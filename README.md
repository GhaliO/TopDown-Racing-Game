# TopDown-Racing-Game

Please download file and use the MIMO simulator to control car with a and d keypads and use the following bitmap display configuration:

Bitmap Display:  
Unit Width = 16  
Unit Height = 16  
Display Width = 512  
Display Height = 512  
Base Address for Display: 0x10008000  
  
You are given only 3 lives and the goal is to dodge oncoming vehicles. You can only use a and d keypads to move car left or right. Every time you collid you lose a life. There is a scoreboard at the top that will start at 3 and then decrease every time you crash. When you pick up a crystal scoreboard increments. As you keep going the speed will get faster and the the game will be harder.
  
Have fun!
